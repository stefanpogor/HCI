QOC (question, options, criteria)

1. 
	q = how will we get users address?
	o = automatically, manual (the user will type it)
	c = the task should be as easy and intuitive as it can
	A hybrid version is used: the user has the option to
give his address automatically, but he can also type it and
it will be corrected if needed.

2.
	q = how will we know where should the user go to recycle
his trash?
	o = let him tell us (input form), give him all the
materials known to be recyclable and let him choose
	c = should be easy to implement
	Using a dropdown selector is easy to implement and 
easy to interact with.

3. 
	q = how will the user be notified about future content?
	o = make him create an account, only ask for email
	c = this process should not take too long else the 
user might lose interest
	Only asking for the email make the process go faster
and easier, the user does not have to go trough the painful
process of creating an account with password and other stuff,
especially because there is no personalized content for each
user.

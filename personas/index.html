					<h5>Main Points</h5>
					<p>Elva is a Housekeeper. She recently got a job at a big hotel and she is being suprised by how much waste some people are doing.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="leftGroup">
					<h5>Goals</h5>
					<p>Her goal is to find a way to recycle all that trash that is left behind costumers because
						the hotel`s management is just throwing it in the garbage bin, all in one place.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="leftGroup">
					<h5>Frustrations and Pain Points</h5>
					<p>Elva does not know what can she do to get all of that garbage recycled, because she has no idea how 
						recycling works.
					</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div itemprop="description" class="detailsRight">
				<h5>Detailed Description</h5>
				<p>Elva goes to work every day and cleans all the rooms that she is assigned to clean. Every single time the
					people that stayed there leave a lot of trash. So far she observed that most of that garbage is uneaten 
					food. She does not have any exeprience with recycling. She came to the conclusion that we really are a
					problem to the environment.
				</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="personaScenarios">
			<h5>Scenarios</h5>
			<p>One day she finished cleaning all the rooms and put all the garbage in one place. Seeing how much trash she collected almost bursted
				in tears. She could not believe such a thing more so she could not stop thinking about of all the food that got wasted. She had enough.
				Went on the app store on her phone and downloaded recyleIT app. There she found out that this really is a problem, she also learned
				how to educate others about food waste and what can she do to reduce it.

					<h5>Main Points</h5>
					<p>Karen does not really likes people. She has 10 fat cats in her house. Every day after she comes home from her job she 
						turns on the tv and starts watching AcasaTV. Sometimes, when she gets bored opens facebook and ask Elon Musk to call his manager.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="leftGroup">
					<h5>Goals</h5>
					<p>She needs to find a way to do something with the leaves that fall from her tree on the ground, because the
						neighbour said that he will call the police if she does not stop throwing them in his yard. She totaly thinks
						that her neighbour is the devil.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="leftGroup">
					<h5>Frustrations and Pain Points</h5>
					<p>Her life is just perfect and everyone wants to be like her, but those leaves...they really drive her crazy.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div itemprop="description" class="detailsRight">
				<h5>Detailed Description</h5>
				<p>Karen lived her best life so far. Cats bring her a lot of joy and she really thinks that cats are the way to heaven.
					People around her really wish to be her, she is just perfect in every way and she knows everything there is to know.
					Does not have friends, because she just does not need them, not after they questioned her believ. Leaves are now her
					enemy, also her neighbour.
				</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="personaScenarios">
			<h5>Scenarios</h5>
			<p>Running out of ideas with what to do with all of those leaves she decided to install this app, recycleIT, that is
				supposed to help with her problem. She really does not trust technology, only the tv, but she risked her life and did it.
				There she found out she can compost the leafes, but she did not like that an app told her what to do so she uninstalled
				the app and left an bad review. Also she called the admin and asked for the manager. She really heates technology.
